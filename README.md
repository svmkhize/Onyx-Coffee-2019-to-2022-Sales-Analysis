## Project Background and Overview
---
OnyX Coffee, established in 2018, is a South Africa-based company that sells coffee in three countries: South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. 
The company has a significant amount of data on its sales, product offerings, and loyalty program, which has been previously underutilized. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this data to uncover insights that will enhance OnyX’s profitability and commercial success. 

<b>Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key business areas:</b>

<b> 1. Sales Trends and Growth Analysis:</b> This involves evaluating OnyX’s historical sales patterns from 2019 to 2024 across its three operations, focusing on revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).<br>
<b> 2. Product Performance:</b> This section includes an analysis of OnyX’s product lines to understand their impact on overall sales.<br>
<b> 3. Loyalty Program Success:</b> This involves assessing the effectiveness of the loyalty program in driving customer sales.

This analysis will assist the OnyX’s product team to identify the most profitable coffee products and optimize pricing, the inventory Management team to ensure that the right quantities of each coffee product are stocked, and the marketing team to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.

## Data Structure Overview
---
OnyX’s database structure as seen below consists of three tables: orders, customers , and products, with a total row of 142 550 records. 

The Dataset was exported from OnyX Coffee MySQL Database as an Excel Sheet which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/svmkhize/OnyX_Coffee_Dataset_Repository/blob/main/OnyX_Coffee_Raw_Dataset.xlsb).

This was inspired by [Kaggle Website Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/coffee-bean-sales-raw-dataset).

## Executive Summary
---
OnyX Coffee has established a strong market presence in the Southern African region, with South Africa being the leading market, accounting for approximately 70% of total sales (ZAR 2,089,839.73) and total orders (99,927). Botswana is the second-largest market, contributing around 20% to total sales (ZAR 418,953.56) and total orders (28,744). Namibia, while smaller, still makes a notable contribution, representing roughly 9.7% of total sales (ZAR 203,520.08) and total orders (13,879).

**Key Observations:**
- **Market Concentration:** A significant portion of OnyX Coffee's revenue and order volume is concentrated in South Africa.
- **Consistent Performance:** The contribution percentage of each country to total sales closely matches its percentage contribution to total orders, indicating a consistent average order value across the markets.
- **Growth Potential:** While South Africa is currently the stronghold, Botswana and Namibia offer opportunities for further growth and market penetration.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Strengthen South African Market Leadership:** Continue investing in and solidifying OnyX Coffee's position in South Africa through targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and possibly expanding product offerings tailored to local consumer preferences.
2. **Explore Growth Opportunities in Botswana and Namibia:** Conduct market research to better understand consumer preferences and identify growth opportunities in Botswana and Namibia. This may involve targeted marketing initiatives, localised distribution strategies, or partnerships to boost brand awareness and market share.
3. **Maintain Consistent Order Value:** Monitor the average order value in each market to ensure profitability and identify any potential shifts in consumer purchasing behaviour.
4. **Consider Regional Expansion:** Based on initial market success, OnyX Coffee could strategically explore expansion into other neighbouring countries in the Southern African region.

By focusing on strengthening its dominant position in South Africa while strategically pursuing growth opportunities in Botswana and Namibia, OnyX Coffee can further enhance its market presence and drive sustainable growth in the region.

## Insights Deep-Dive
---
### Sales Trends and Growth Rates

OnyX Coffee's sales data from 2019 to 2024 shows a generally stable performance with a slight upward trend over the six-year period.

### Sales Trends

**Key Observations:**
- **Stable Average Order Value (AOV):** The Average Order Value has consistently remained at R21 throughout these years, suggesting a stable pricing strategy and consistent purchasing behavior per order.
- **Fluctuating Order Counts:** While the AOV has been steady, the order count has experienced minor fluctuations year-over-year. The highest order count was recorded in 2022 with 24,075 orders, while the lowest was in 2020 with 23,336 orders.
- **Gradual Sales Growth:** Overall, total sales have shown a gradual increase from R493,447 in 2019 to R500,853 in 2024.

### Growth Rates

**Growth Observations:**
- The year-over-year growth rate has been relatively modest, ranging from a decrease of 1.76% to an increase of 2.75%.
- The decline in 2020 may be attributed to the initial impacts of the global pandemic on consumer behaviour.
- The strongest growth was observed in 2022.
- A slight dip occurred in 2023, followed by a small recovery in 2024.

### Implications and Considerations

- **Stability as an Asset:** The consistent AOV indicates a reliable customer base and effective pricing strategy.
- **Opportunities for Increased Order Volume:** Although sales are growing slightly, implementing strategies to boost order volume could result in more significant revenue growth, especially given the stable AOV.
- **External Factors:** Analysing external influences (e.g., economic conditions, competitor activities) may provide insights into the fluctuations in order counts and sales growth.
- **Future Growth Strategies:** Initiatives to attract new customers or encourage more frequent purchases from existing customers could be crucial for accelerating growth.

### Product Performance

### Loyalty Program Performance

- The non-loyalty program/non-member contributed 52% (521) of all orders, generating 54% ($24,216) more in sales revenue. 
- The non-loyalty program/non-member spent $46 more on average per order than the $44 spent by the loyalty program/member. 
- The non-loyalty program/non-member lead in key metrics because there is no incentive in being part of a loyalty program. Hence, most customers are reluctant to join the program.

## Recommendations
---
### Maximizing Product Offerings

- The current coffee catalog continues to generate acceptable sales, but an investigation has to be conducted to understand why the Robusta coffee type is trailing behind. 

### Loyalty Program Enhancements

- Initiate an onboarding campaign that offers first-purchase discounts and tiered rewards for existing loyalty program members that will further incentivize frequent purchases and strengthen customer loyalty.

### Regional Growth Strategies

- Focus on Low-Performing Operations by allocating additional resources to the marketing department to introduce tailored promotions in both Namibia and Botswana. 
- Consider expanding OnyX Coffee to the rest of the SADC countries.
